# DEVELOPMENT-OF-NOISE-ABSORBING-MATERIALS-USING-AGRO-WASTE-PRODUCTS-
The project focuses on the development of effective noise-absorbing materials
utilizing agricultural waste as a sustainable and cost-efficient resource. Noise pollution has
become a pressing concern in urban and industrial environments, necessitating innovative
solutions that can mitigate its adverse effects on human health and well-being. Agricultural
waste, which is abundantly available and often underutilized, presents an opportunity to create
environmentally friendly noise-absorbing materials. Noise created by different machines can
be controlled either by suppressing the noise-generating factors or by using noise-proofing
materials which help to reduce the acoustic waveâ€™s energy by blocking or absorption.
Traditionally, noise is controlled by using expensive and non-biodegradable sound-absorbing
materials such as glass wool, polymer foams, fabric filler, and polymer fibers, posing additional
harm to the environment. The health risk factors associated with glass-and mineral-fiber
materials, also provide an opportunity to develop the soundproofing material made of naturally
available materials. At present the focus is to develop a cheap, renewable, and biodegradable
soundproofing material with maximum utilization of agro-waste material Such as Rice husk to
develop Noise absorbing material and study of acoustical and flexural properties of
Composites.
